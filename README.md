# Mid-Bootcamp-Project
This project marks the middle of the Data Analytics Bootcamp and it's a good way to check the progress so far.

The data base consists on customer's information from banking and loan services.

The main goal is to understand the demographics and other characteristics of the bank customers that accepted or not a credit card offer.

In order to assess and predict acceptance probabilities a model was developed by using logistic regression, after data cleaning, wrangling and EDA on the database. The variable 'Offer accepted' was considered the target.

The project contains the following files:

    - .gitignore
    - creditcardmarketing.csv 
    - Initial_trial.ipynb
    - Query_1.sql
    - README.md

- .gitignore: Contains the 'confidencial' files.

- creditcardmarketing.csv: Provided database.

- Initial_trial.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the data cleaning/wrangling, EDA and modeling.

- Query_1.sql: script used to create a SQL the simulated database from a bank.

- README.md: explanation about project goals, files and workflow.
